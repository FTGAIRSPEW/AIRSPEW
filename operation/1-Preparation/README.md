AirSpew: Modular Information Dissemination System

## Preparation
In order to prepare for flight the battery associated with the module should be charged completely. 
* The speaker/battery combination for use in the speaker and radio modules has a “battery” check button on the rear (close to the AUX IN)
* The smaller battery used on the drop module has a button on top to check charge level

For most of the connections between the module components and the drone are completed with zip-ties, we recommend reusable zip ties (shipped with unit) because they can be easily released and re-used. For cable management use velcro (shipped with unit) to reduce loose cables

One of the drone’s controller’s channel buttons must be configured to turn on/off the rear LEDs, this will be used as the trigger to active the payloads, use the included pry tool to remove existing LED cover

All modules use the processing unit; as such it should be mounted first on the drone:
