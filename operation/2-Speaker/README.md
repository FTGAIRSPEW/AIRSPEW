## Speaker Module
Using a computer access the blue USB drive and edit the mode.txt file to indicate speaker mode by typing “speaker” into the file. Save the desired message for broadcast under the “speaker” folder, it can be named anything as long as it has a WAV extension, most WAV audio formats supported; it has been tested with a 44.1 KHz 32-bit float PCM WAV. Insert the USB drive back into the 4 port USB hub on the drone.

For the speaker module attach the panel with the large speaker to the bottom of the drone, secure with zip-ties:

Plug in the processing units USB cable into the battery and turn on the battery/speaker.

Wait until the blue LED closes to the Ethernet header (one of four LEDs) on the processing unit is on; this indicates that the processing unit and drop module have been initialized properly - this should take approximately 30 seconds after connecting the battery.
