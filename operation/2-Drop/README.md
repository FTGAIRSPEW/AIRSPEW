Attach the servo’s USB cable to the 4 port USB hub and attach the processing unit’s single servo signal cable (black cable, loose end was inserted into styrofoam block for protection) to the servo’s signal cable (the only populated pin in the servo’s header):

Power on the drone’s controller and drone and wait for system checks to complete. Using the configured button check that you are able to turn on/off the drone’s LED’s – check the LED opposite of the one covered.

Plug in the processing units USB cable into the battery that resides in top of the paper tray.

Wait until the blue LED closes to the Ethernet header (one of four LEDs) on the processing unit is on; this indicates that the processing unit and drop module have been initialized properly - this should take approximately 30 seconds after connecting the battery:
