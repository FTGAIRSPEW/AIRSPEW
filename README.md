AirSpew: Modular Information Dissemination System

Artifact repository for team Fowado Technology Group's submission to SOFWERX's OpenWERX Challenge: AirSpew

Under construction, full content will be populated very soon!

Description of Folders:
* developed – contains all developed source for the project and file descriptions
* media - media files captured during development and testing
* miscfiles - miscellaneous files
* reference – contains reference documents for main system components
* sample-usb-control-drive  – contains the folder structure and sample content of a control USB drive


Operation Notes:
* During testing best response was found using DJI's Atti flight mode - this is our recommended flight mode when the modules are attached
* When using the included LED signal kit in an outdoor setting with a lot of natural light it is recommended to cover the outside of the chosen LED with electrical tape to reduce the chance of a false trigger. The prototype consists of a blacked out LED cover, future plan would be to make this piece out of plastic
